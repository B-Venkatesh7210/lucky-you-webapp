Lucky You is a decentralised web app for creating and participating in giveaways of Matic tokens, in which the winner is chosen completely random and is transferred the amount of the giveaway. The winner then has the choice to mint NFT of that particular giveaway.

It solves the problem caused in web2 giveaway platforms where the users have to depend on a midddleware and sometimes the winners of the giveaway are not even declared, while in the case of LUCKY YOU you don't have to worry much but try your luck.

# Technologies used in LuckyYou:

* Gelato - Gelato helps in automating the contract so that when the time reaches giveaway deadline the endGiveaway() function is called using specific taskId of every giveaway.
* Chainlink - Chainlink is used to generate random number off the chain because if the algortihm was written in smart contract then it would have been misused by many miscreants. So to prevent the Chainlink helps in generating random number and declaring a winner using the same.
* Filecoin/IPFS - When a winner is declared, they have the choice to mint their NFT, and those NFTs ared stored in IPFS.
